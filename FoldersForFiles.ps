# This script is for creating a folder for each file and then moving each file into its own folder. It assumes all your files have the same name length.
# Replace <foldername> with the folder containing your files
# Adjust “Substring(0,8)” to account for the number of characters in the file names.
#   If <8 characters, part of file name gets cut-off from folder
#   If >8 characters, there’s an error
